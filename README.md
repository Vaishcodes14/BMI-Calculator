# BMI-Calculator
BMI calculator built using Python. Calculates BMI from user input and classifies it into health categories: underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.


# 🧮 BMI Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python project to calculate **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using user input and conditional logic. This calculator determines the user's health status based on their weight and height and classifies it into categories like underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

## 📌 Features

- Calculates BMI using the formula:
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{(\text{Height (m)})^2}
  \]
- Classifies BMI into:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- Handles invalid inputs with proper validation
- Uses simple functions and conditionals — perfect for Python beginners
